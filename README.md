This is a simple point and click game made with css, js, and html. It features a handful of bird pokemon as playable characters that the user can select as their avatar for the duration of the game. The goal is to find the key and unlock the castle, pending other locations and goals given time (there is none).






## FAQ

#### How do you run the game?

   Clone it and run the html with live server / the method of your choice. That should be it.

#### How do you select your character?

   On the character select screen, click the arrows in the middle of the screen below the pokemon to cycle through options.
   Once you find what you like, press "Onward".

#### What's the goal of the game?
   The goal is to find the key and unlock the castle so far. This can be accomplished by clicking on various objects to navigate around / 
   interact with them


## MVP
For the MVP, the identified features were as follows:

   The user should be able to collect an item
   The user should be able to pick a character
   The user should be able to bypass roadblocks with the use of their items

The reasoning here is that, aside from base functionality outlined in the prototype of features, these are the things that would most inform the gameplay. Once these things were accomplished - the scope of the game was only limited by time to create assets.

Some stretch goals would challenge this - like having NPC's and the ability to converse or fight - as they would require new base functions. These were viewed as far enough out to not be included in the MVP however.
