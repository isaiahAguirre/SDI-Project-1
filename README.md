# SDI-Project-1
This is a simple point and click game made with css, js, and html. It features a handful of bird pokemon as playable characters that the user can select as their avatar for the duration of the game. The goal is to find the key and unlock the castle, pending other locations and goals given time (there is none).

## Lessons Learned

You'll always need more time than you thought, at least solo. Without a team to balance out strengths and weakness - some stuff is gonna drag. Sort of in a similar vein, it's very easy to focus on just the parts you like / are good at and expand the scope that way while initial goals remain neglected.
